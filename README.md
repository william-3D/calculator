Simple web calculator built with HTML, CSS and vanilla JavaScript.
Design inspired by Alison Danis's Daily UI #4 on Dribble: https://dribbble.com/shots/10071859-Daily-UI-4-Calculator

Basic calculator that can chain operations e.g. 4x5-10+2

Bugs to fix:
- when "%" is used and the result is 0, calculator does not work until "AC" button clicked
- it should not allow symbols if there is no value e.g. (XXXX9 = NaN)
- visual bug of chaining symbols

Features to be added:
- reset calculator when a new number is clicked on after an operation is complete
